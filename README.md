# Problem Statement :-

The Aim is to assist Teachers and Students to learn thing and understand them not only through reading but also involving them into and interactive quiz section so that he/she can test what points they are weaker in, so that they can improve themselves.

The main requirement of application is to find questions and
answers. In this application firstly the user need to register or
login using user-id and password. 

Then the user can choose any
of the quiz of his/her choice. Before starting the quiz there is a
instruction window in which there are instruction related to
attempt the quiz. After it user can start attaining the quiz. Here
user can see his/her answers are right or wrong and can also see

the answer of each. If there is any query related to it user can ask
it. 

After completion of the quiz user will get credit score for each
of its correct answers. Initially the questions are given by the
admin but after sometime the user itself can submit questions
and its answers. After verification by the admin the questions are
shown on the window.

The query related to a question can we
solved by admin as well as the users of this application.

# Application Link & Future Scope :-

1. Engage your audience

Engage your audience in a unique and fun way and connect them to your brand or learning material. By creating a returning event, you will improve your consumer loyalty.

2. Large number

Taking online quizzes makes it possible to have a large number of participants. It could be up to a number of 1000 participants (and even more!). It doesn’t matter at what kind of location they take the online quiz as long as they are connected to the Internet.

3. Randomizing questions

It is significant more easy to randomize your question with just one click than to do it all manually. Randomizing questions and even answers of those questions is not a lot a of work to do with online quizzes. Besides the advantage of time saving, it also helps preventing students from cheating.

4. Quiz results/ gain insight in audience
 
Another plus of online quizzes is getting immediate results from your participants. Not only does the creator get the results, the participant itself is also possible to get his or her results. This makes it for the creator easy to identify the gaps in knowledge. The participants are able to view on what kind of section they have to improve themselves.

5. No instructor needed
 
Quizzes can be given without an instructor, which saves money and time :)

6. Set timer
 
The creator is able to set a timer for the whole quiz or to set a timer per question. This is possible to do with written quizzes, but is very time consuming for the instructor. Plus it’s almost impossible to do with a huge amount of participants.

7. Better overview

It’s possible to show one question at the time with online quizzes. People are not able to skip a question, because you will get a reminder that you can’t leave the answer blank.

8. Improve your brand

There are several ways to gain more brand awareness: Generate new interactive sales opportunities, build your traffic to your online channels, improve time spent on site and improve the sharing on social media about your campaign and brand.
