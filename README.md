Implemented a Quiz app using kotlin, jetpack-compose for Innovathon 2022 by GDSC PVGCOET

-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Problem Statement :-

The Aim is to assist Teachers and Students to learn thing and understand them not only through reading but also involving them into and interactive quiz section so that he/she can test what points they are weaker in, so that they can improve themselves.

The main requirement of application is to find questions and
answers. In this application firstly the user need to register or
login using user-id and password. 

Then the user can choose any
of the quiz of his/her choice. Before starting the quiz there is a
instruction window in which there are instruction related to
attempt the quiz. After it user can start attaining the quiz. Here
user can see his/her answers are right or wrong and can also see

the answer of each. If there is any query related to it user can ask
it. 

After completion of the quiz user will get credit score for each
of its correct answers. Initially the questions are given by the
admin but after sometime the user itself can submit questions
and its answers. After verification by the admin the questions are
shown on the window.

The query related to a question can we
solved by admin as well as the users of this application.
